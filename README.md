# Password Generator

## About The Project
This application has been developed to allow a user generate random password based on criteria they have selected. It has been developed to practice my knowledge of intermediate JavaScript and designed using pre-populated HTML and CSS codes.

## Installation
N/A


## Usage
The application runs in the browser and enables the user to generate a randon password once they have confirmed their preferred password length and types of character. Once these have been specified, the random password is displayed on to the web page. This process can be repeated multiple times to generate several passwords. The application has been optimised for use on multiple screen sizes. 

  ### Roadmap
  Here is an overview of the process to generate a password with length = 20 that includes a mix of special, numeric, lowercase and   uppercase characters. If the user does not require all four characters includes, select 'cancel' when the confirm window pops up.
